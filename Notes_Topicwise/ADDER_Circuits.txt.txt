Arithmetic circuits that perform addition operations:
- Adder circuits are electronic circuits designed to perform arithmetic operations, specifically addition.
- These circuits are used extensively in digital systems, such as computers, calculators, and other devices that require mathematical calculations.

Basic addition consists of 4 possible operations: 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=10:
- In binary arithmetic, the basic addition operations involve adding two binary digits, commonly referred to as bits.
- When adding two 0's, the result is always 0.
- When adding 0 and 1, the result is 1.
- When adding 1 and 0, the result is 1.
- When adding two 1's, the result is 10 in binary representation, which means a carry of 1 and a sum of 0.

Two types of Adder Circuits: Half Adder and Full Adder:
1. Half Adder:
- A half adder is a basic adder circuit that can only add two binary digits without considering any carry-in.
- It consists of two inputs, A and B, which represent the binary digits to be added, and two outputs, SUM and CARRY.
- The SUM output represents the sum of A and B, while the CARRY output indicates if there is a carry generated during the addition operation.

2. Full Adder:
- A full adder is an enhanced version of the half adder that takes into account any carry-in from previous stages.
- It has three inputs: A, B, and CARRY_IN, where CARRY_IN represents the carry generated in the previous stage of addition.
- The outputs of a full adder are SUM, which represents the sum of the three inputs, and CARRY_OUT, which indicates if there is a carry-out generated after the addition.

Comparison between Half Adder and Full Adder:
- While a half adder can only add two bits at a time, a full adder can add three bits, taking into account both the carry-in and carry-out.
- The full adder provides a more complete and comprehensive addition operation, making it useful for multi-digit addition.
- The sum obtained from a half adder is essentially the same as the sum output from a full adder without considering carry-in or carry-out.
