 The output of a combinational circuit depends on its present . Only the past inputs of a Sequential circuit . Digital circuits (Digital Circuits) are of two types . Combinational Circuits (Digital . Electronics) Digital Electronics is of two type .  Adder Circuits are of two types: half-adder and full-adder . Realization using AOI logic is possible using one X-OR gate and one AND gate . The full Adder circuit is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits) The Full Adder adds the bits A and B and the carry-in C in and outputs the sum bit S .  A half-subtractor is a combinational circuit that subtracts one bit from the other and produces the difference . It also has an output to specify if a 1 has been borrowed . It is used to subtract LSB of the subtrahend from LSB when one binary number is subtracted from the minuend . The circuit can be realized using X-OR gates and AOI gates . An n-bit parallel adder is a digital circuit that adds two b  The output carry is the output of a full subtractor using only 2-input NAND gates . The carry-out of each full-adder is the carry-in to the next most significant stage of a ripple carry adder . The subtraction A - B can be done by taking the 2's complement of B and adding it to A .  When M = 0, the circuit is an adder, and when M = 1, it becomes a subtractor . The speed with which an addition can be performed is governed by the time it takes for the carries to propagate or ripple through the stages of the adder . The look-ahead-carry adder speeds up the process by eliminating this ripple carry delay .  Full adder is made of two half-adders and the half-adder contains an X-OR gate to produce the sum and an AND gate . The input carry Cn has to be propagated to the output only if Pn is 1 or both Gn and Pn are equal to 1 . The general expression for n stages designated as 0 through (n-1) would be: "Cn Gn-1 + Pn"  A code converter is a logic circuit whose inputs are bit-patterns representing numbers (or characters) in one code and the corresponding representations in a different code . A code conversion table is a conversion table with the input and output of a 4 bit binary to Gray-style code converter . The output of the converted code table is B4-bit G4 G3 Gâ‚‚ .  A 4-bit Gcode converter would be called a "4-bit" Gcode Converter . The input is a Gray code with the output a 4bit binary code . Only one output line is activated for each one of the possible combinations of inputs . A decoder is a logic circuit that converts an N-bit-binary input code into M output lines .  ABC-Dg decoder takes a three-line input line and eight input lines . A particular output as determined by the A, B, C input of each gate will go HIGH only when the ENABLE line is held high . The opposite of the decoding process is called encoding . An encoder is a device whose inputs are decimal digits and/oralphabetic characters .  An octal-to-binary encoder accepts 8 input lines, only one of which is activated at a given time, and produces an N-bit output code depending on which input is activated . A2 is a 1 if any of the digits D4 or D5 or D6 or D7 is a '1' and A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7 and D i is 'don't care' because D i isn't present in  The figure is based on the 1-to-N device . It is called DeMultiplexer (DeMux) The figure illustrates comparison of 8 and 4, and the result is HIGH (8 > 4) The result is the result of the comparison of A and B, A = B or A > B, depending on the magnitude of the input quantities .
