## A Brief of the Prototype:
  This is a project or website named(Dynamic Education System) is basically to bifercate the whole lot of content present on the web according to the quality of materials or the       quantity of knowledge in contents.
  This website helps students get better contents related to any domain of interest and can even help them give test to access direct certifications.
  This website helps student even cop up with the pace of the world by getting about the rest of the world's technology by the use of the chatbox present in the website.
  Our website works on webscrapping which scraps the data present on all the educational sites, youtube etc. and bifercates the best content related to a topic and domain. 
  
## Tech Stack: 
  
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This is a website which start with index.html on the source code folder.
  Then the further navigations can me made according to needs.
  
## What I Learned:
  The best about this project I got to make my knowledge to get boosted by some technologies:
  1. AI Bifercation
  2. Web scrapping
  3. One DNN (Neural network library)

  The best part of our knowledge journey was completing a project based on collaborating AI bifercation, web scrapping and one DNN.
