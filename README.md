## A Brief of the Prototype:
# UML diagram ![image](https://github.com/mansi12340/object_detection_for_autonomous_vehicles_oneAPI/blob/main/Flowchart.png)
    The project aims towards the detection of two main things that have been the major contributors in the road accidents :-
  1) object detection= Our project detects the objects in front of the vehicles in a range of 10 metres to 40 metres.
  2)pothole detection= Our project detects the potholes in front of the vehicles in the range 5 metres to 6 metres with accuracy.
  Other than this, our project can detect the object and vehicles in night and in fog which is the most suitable thing to avoid accidents.

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed.
  
## What I Learned:
  1) We learnt to interface the raspberry pi cam with the raspberry pi board.
  2) How to create a model using intel one API toolkit.
  3) How to detect the potholes and other objects using tensorflow embedding in raspberry pi cam.
  4) How to use LIDAR sensor for the detction of objects
