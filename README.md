# intel-oneAPI


#### Team Name - ggbois   
#### Problem Statement - Object Detection For Autonomous Vehicles
#### Team Leader Email - zubair.mh@protonmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
Autonomous Vehicles implement SLAM(Simulataneous Localization and Mapping) in order to implement autopilot/self driving features, however such SLAM implementations can be slow due to lack of parallelization and slow libraries. By leveraging the oneAPI's DPC++ platform and acceleration API's , we aim to create a SLAM implementation that is not only fast but accurate and production ready.
